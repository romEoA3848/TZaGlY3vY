Algorithm Optimization with Streamlit
==============================

This application allows users to input an initial population and parameters to
execute a genetic algorithm for optimization.

The genetic algorithm is a search heuristic that mimics the process of natural
evolution. It is typically used to generate high-quality solutions to optimization
and search problems by relying on bio-inspired operators such as mutation, crossover,
and selection.
